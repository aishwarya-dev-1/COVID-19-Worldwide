# Time Series Analysis of Coronavirus in the world

The aim of this project is to predict the future coronavirus cases and deaths all around the world by focusing on the current time series analysis.
Different models like Naïve Bayes, Mean and Arima models are applied and their accuracies are compared to determine the best model.

The dataset was obtained from https://ourworldindata.org/coronavirus-source-data

Upon comparing the average training and testing set accuracies for each model and by choosing the model that worked better than the others in most cases, the best model was chosen.

This project contains data visualizations done on Tableau :-
